# Hierarchy
The rulebook is composed of different levels of sections like so:
- Section: Sections are major topics like "mech building". Sections headings should use `h1` headings.
- Subsection: Sections are composed of subsections representing sub topics. Each subsection should be one or more physical pages in length.


# HTML Guidelines
- In general, keep line length below 100 characters.
- The content of `<p></p>` tags should start on a new line.
